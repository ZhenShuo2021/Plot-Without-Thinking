# Plot Without Thinking
See me if you want to plot xy figure in Matlab or Matplotlib.
## Why this example
There are not any all in one tutorial on internet. Plot a nice look xy figure is very time wasting.  
To plot a xy figure that you won't get _ by your professor, just use this example.  
I had try my best to make it IEEE alike. Larger xy label and axis, sequential legend follow by line order.   
Disclaim for don't take any responsibility.
